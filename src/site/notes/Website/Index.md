# Welcome to Ion Drive 
### Launching my self-hosting journey with my first server, Titan

Have you ever started a new hobby and immediately realized you were going to become obsessed with it? That was self-hosting for me. 

I am still very early into my self-hosting journey as I only spun up my first server, [[Website/Blog/Meet Titan\|Titan]], a few months ago. 

My goal with this website is to document that journey as I continue down this rabbit hole. I love the idea of [learning in public](https://wanderloots.xyz/digital-garden/published/learn-in-public/) so that hopefully others can learn along with me.  

I envision this website as having two main sections: blogs and guides. In the blogs, I plan to document my thoughts and learning of various topics in more of a freeform manner. Whereas, in the guides, I plan to document specific step by step instructions as I accomplish new things with Titan. I started making guides for myself so that I could actually remember how, and what, I had done. Then realized it would be just as useful for other! 

My first [[Website/Guides/Digital Garden and Obsidian\|guide]] goes over how I published this very website on Github Pages using Obsidian. 

I hope you enjoy it.
